# Overview 
An overview course in spatial data management and analysis, starting with basic concepts and key features of QGIS for loading and styling features to analysis using more advanced techniques to answer interesting and important analytical and operational questions. No experience with spatial data or GIS applications is assumed and all exercises use real-world data sets.

# Goals
During the course of this training, the instructors will:
+ Describe the foundational concepts of spatial analysis and mapmaking
+ Describe the general structure and purpose of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
+ Describe spatial data formats and sources of spatial data
+ Demonstrate best practices for loading, styling, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data
+ Apply concepts of spatial analysis to real-world problems using real-world data
+ Discuss resources for further information and instruction on QGIS and other spatial analysis tools

# Learning Objectives
At the conclusion of the training, participants will:
+ Be familiar with the foundational concepts and key advanced concepts in spatial analysis and mapmaking
+ Understand the structure and purpose of GIS
+ Be practiced in applying spatial concepts to real-world problems
+ Be familiar with the differences between open source and proprietary software applications
+ Be familiar with resources for further information on how to use QGIS for spatial analysis and mapmaking
