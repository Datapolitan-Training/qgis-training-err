+ One mic
--

+ Respect multiple perspectives 
--

+ Assume noble regard and positive intent

# Introductions
In pairs, please share with your partner:
+ Your name
+ What you do
+ Your level of comfort with QGIS (1 - 10)
+ What you hope to get from class this week

You'll be introducing your partner to the class (so take notes)

---

# Assumptions
--

+ You're all busy
--

+ You're all mostly self-taught
--

+ You're all motivated to learn how to better use QGIS
--

+ You all know your data better than I could (and might want to take a break from it)

---
class:center,middle

# How We're Going to Do This

---
# How I Teach
--

+ Minimal lecture
--

+ Demonstrate a concept/technique with open data
--

+ Learn by doing -> I'll guide you along the way

---
# How our Days Are Going to Go
--

+ 2 85-minute sessions
--

+ 10-minute break in between
--

+ "Your turn" towards end of each block
--

+ "Peer Mapping" -> work in pairs with one person driving
--

+ "Homework" -> a 10-15 minute task to demo the next day

---

# How the Week is going to look
--

+ **Monday** - Introduction to QGIS, loading data, filtering, and selecting
--

+ **Tuesday** - Projections, buffering features, spatial joins
--

+ **Wednesday** - Creating and editing features, validating geometries
--

+ **Thursday** - Georeferencing and "Bonus" section

---

# Outcomes
At the end of this week, you will:
--

+ Demonstrate proficiency with foundational concepts in spatial analysis
--

+ Understand the structure and purpose of a GIS
--

+ Be practiced using QGIS to accomplish simple and sophisticated spatial operations
--

+ Demonstrate proficiency in applying spatial concepts to real-world problems
--

+ Be familiar with resources for further information on how to use QGIS for spatial analysis and mapmaking

---

# Topics for Today
--

+ Basic operations in QGIS (loading, styling, filtering, and exporting data)
--

+ Essential GIS definitions and concepts
--

+ Pro-tips for working with QGIS
